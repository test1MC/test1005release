        <p>Tapping on the signature field, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be able to capture a signature, After a signature has been captured the operative can also do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancel - Will disregard the signature that was captures</li>
            <li>Clear - Remove the signature allowing the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to re-capture a signature </li>
            <li>OK - Saves the signature that has been captured</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>Once the signature has been captured and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> taps "SAVE", the application will prompt the operative to answer a few questions.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> selects "No", the application will go to the "SIGN" screen where the signatures captured will be listed. However, if the operative selects "Yes" then the application will display the "Survey" for the operative to complete.</p>
