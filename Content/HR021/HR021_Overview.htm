        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1">Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">Previously, when the <span class="parameter">PRHR </span>Company parameter was used (to ensure employee record management between HR and PR modules), the HR Personnel <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaving date" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> was disabled and could not be entered since it is synced with the PR Employee <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaving date" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />. For example, if an employee handed in their notice, the HR user was unable to enter the last day of service on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk leaver" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> screen.</p>
        <p class="Body">For the UK Region, this occurred because the Employee <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaving date" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> is tied to PR processes to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Financial Periods caps" />; consequently, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaving date" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> in HR was only updated when the PR <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk leaver" /> status eventually reached number ‘2’, which was after the employee had left. This process resulted in the following issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Caused the management of large scale redundancies or normal <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk leaver" /> processes to be difficult.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Forced users to create fields or use the HR ‘status’ flag to denote a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk leaver" />.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Produced inaccurate HR reports since employees would often have left but still remained current until Payroll processing was completed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">In an effort to alleviate these issues, Human Resources has been updated to allow the entry of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaving date" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> from the Personnel screen, even if the <span class="parameter">CO/PRHR</span> parameter has been set, as long as the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>parameter <span class="parameter">HR/HRPRLEAV </span>is set to <strong>WORKBENCH</strong>.</p>
        <p class="Body">Details about the changes made in COINS&#160;OA are described in this document.</p>
